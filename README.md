# Courses Card App
The Courses Card App is a React web application that provides users with an extensive course catalog that they can browse through and select courses of their interest. With its intuitive navbar, the application allows users to filter courses based on their types, including "All", "Dev", "Business", and "Design". Users can interact with the course cards and like their favorite courses, just like on popular edtech platforms like Udemy and Coursera.
